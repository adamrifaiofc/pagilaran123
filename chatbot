The main challenges faced by PT Pagilaran in the environmental aspect include:
Land Use and Biodiversity Conservation:
PT Pagilaran operates in a region with significant biodiversity. The company must balance its agricultural activities with the conservation of natural habitats and species. This includes implementing sustainable agricultural practices to minimize the impact on local ecosystems.
Waste Management:
The company has implemented strict policies against indiscriminate littering, hunting, and polluting rivers. However, managing waste from agricultural activities and tourism remains a challenge. PT Pagilaran has to ensure that waste is properly disposed of or recycled to prevent environmental degradation.
Climate Change and Weather Variability:
Climate change poses a significant threat to agricultural productivity. PT Pagilaran must adapt to changing weather patterns, which can affect tea and cocoa production. This includes implementing measures to mitigate the effects of droughts, floods, and other extreme weather events.
Sustainable Tourism Development:
While agrotourism is a significant part of PT Pagilaran’s business, it also brings environmental challenges. For example, the company has to manage the environmental impact of tourist activities, such as paragliding, which was considered but postponed due to potential damage to tea plants.
Regulatory Compliance:
PT Pagilaran must comply with various environmental regulations, including those related to the use of pesticides, waste management, and conservation of natural resources. Ensuring that all operations meet these standards is crucial for sustainable development.
Energy Use and Emissions:
The production processes at PT Pagilaran’s factories require significant energy, leading to emissions. The company has to manage its energy use efficiently and reduce its carbon footprint. For instance, a study found that producing one kilogram of green tea at PT Pagilaran’s Samigaluh factory required 68,534.14 KJ of energy and released various emissions, including CO2, HC, NOx, and Pb.
Community Involvement and Education:
Engaging the local community in sustainable practices is essential. PT Pagilaran needs to continue educating and involving local residents in environmental conservation efforts to ensure long-term sustainability.
Addressing these challenges requires a holistic approach that integrates environmental management into the core operations of PT Pagilaran, ensuring that both agricultural and tourism activities are sustainable and have minimal environmental impact.
